# Neopets-Userscripts

 ### Mark Blocked Users
 Once you add the script (using Tampermonkey or whichever you use), visit your blocklist. <br>
 https://www.neopets.com/block.phtml

 The script will read your list of blocked users. When you go on the neoboards, users who have been blocked's names will be red (or a different color, you can change the variable in the code). If you click on their post, you'll get a confirmation message informing you that you have them blocked and asking if you want to continue. Additionally, if they leave a reply on any board, their name will be that same color, to indicate that they're blocked. 

 I have 40 users blocked and at this point it's hard to remember who's who. TNT is finally enforcing the block function (a little bit more) so I definitely encourage using it
