# Neopets-Userscripts
 ### Flagged Users (Includes Mark Blocked Users)
 This includes the same functionality as Mark Blocked Users, but adds an option to flag users. Your flagged list will show up on the same page as your blocked list (https://www.neopets.com/block.phtml) and users can be flagged/unflagged from either that page or directly on the neoboards. Unlike blocking users, there's no native functionality for flagging users so it is not something TNT will recognize in any way as this is just a userscript. It's just to aid in keeping track of users who you either you take issue with but not enough to block, or those you want to be wary of. Users that have been flagged will have their names in an orangey yellow or whichever color you'd like. (Change it at the top of the code). 

 ### Mark Blocked Users
 Once you add the script (using Tampermonkey or whichever you use), visit your blocklist. <br>
 https://www.neopets.com/block.phtml

 The script will read your list of blocked users. When you go on the neoboards, users who have been blocked's names will be red (or a different color, you can change the variable in the code). If you click on their post, you'll get a confirmation message informing you that you have them blocked and asking if you want to continue. Additionally, if they leave a reply on any board, their name will be that same color, to indicate that they're blocked. 

 I have 40 users blocked and at this point it's hard to remember who's who. TNT is finally enforcing the block function (a little bit more) so I definitely encourage using it
